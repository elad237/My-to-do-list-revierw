# To-do-list

> In this project, I will build a simple yet functional To-do list. A To-do list is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. I will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you I will do it using ES6 and Webpack!
>In this project, I implement the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods. All the elements of the user interface will be fully functional and your application will be completed.
